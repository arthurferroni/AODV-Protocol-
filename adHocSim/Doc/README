This model works with OMNeT++ v. 2.2

To run the simulator just:

- type opp_makemake
- type make
- type adHocSim


The omnetpp.ini file contains almost all the parameters needed.
Editing the Ini/mobility.ini  file you can choose the mobility model to use.

The 'script' shell script executes many runs with different speeds and seeds.

The NewAwk directory contains some awk and shell script that generate graph with
gnuplot processing the 'collectedData.dat' simulator output file.

Roughly patched up for OMNeT++ 3.0 Andras Varga 2005 January.
